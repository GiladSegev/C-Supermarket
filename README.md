# C-Supermarket
A simple struct based C program to manage a supermarket

A simple command-line program that manages the products in a store by being able to add, remove, print, and update the
products in the store.
Each product in the store is described with several parameters such as barcode, name, price, expiration date, and so on.
The barcode is unique for each product.

Before each command, a program will print a generic menu that asks the user to choose the
operation to perform. Possibilities include adding a product, removing a product, listing the
expired products, listing all the products, and updating the product details.
